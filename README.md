# Ajadi Taoreed Olawale — Backend Developer | Problem Solver | Fast Learner

🎓 **Trained at Semicolon Africa** | 💼 **Backend Intern @ SpringCore Africa**

🚀 About Me

I’m a former teacher turned backend developer with a strong foundation in computer science principles and a passion for building scalable, secure systems. I thrive on solving real-world problems, quickly learning new technologies, and delivering clean, maintainable code. My strength lies in **conceptual clarity**, making me adaptable to any tech stack.

🔎 I love asking "why" before "how" — because great developers understand the *why* behind the *code*.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

- **Clean, Maintainable Code**: Built an event management system (Eplant) with role-based access and vendor management using Spring Boot, ensuring scalability and security.
- **Database Management**: Designed efficient schemas in MySQL for event management and classifieds-like apps, optimizing data retrieval.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented secure JWT-based auth for multiple projects, including Eplant and D\_Clutter, with role-based access control.
- **Multi-Tenant System Design**: Developed tenancy models for an e-commerce platform, handling 100+ concurrent users during testing.
- **REST & GraphQL APIs**: Created APIs for event registration, user management, and blockchain payments.
- **Deployment**: Deployed apps using Docker, Railway, and Render for seamless production rollouts.
- **Fast Learner**: Mastered the Move language in 2 weeks to build a blockchain payment system on Sui Blockchain.

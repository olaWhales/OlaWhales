# Ajadi Taoreed Olawale — Backend Developer | Problem Solver | Fast Learner

🎓 **Trained at Semicolon Africa** | 💼 **Backend Intern @ SpringCore Africa** |  ** Currently Backend engineer @ Semicolon Lab** 

🚀 About Me

I’m a former teacher turned backend developer with a strong foundation in computer science principles and a passion for building scalable, secure systems. I thrive on solving real-world problems, quickly learning new technologies, and delivering clean, maintainable code. My strength lies in **conceptual clarity**, making me adaptable to any tech stack.

🔎 I love asking "why" before "how" — because great developers understand the *why* behind the *code*.
## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

- **Scalable Architecture Design**: Engineered a multi-role eCommerce backend using Java and Spring Boot, applying Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design to ensure modularity and long-term maintainability.
- **Clean, Maintainable Code**: Built the Eplant event management system with layered modular architecture, supporting vendor roles and secure access control.
- **Robust Database Modeling**: Designed optimized MySQL schemas for event platforms and internal tools, improving query performance and data integrity.
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access across multiple projects, including Eplant and Biometric Login.
- **Multi-Tenant System Design**: Developed tenancy models for eCommerce platforms, successfully tested with 100+ concurrent users.
- **API Development**: Delivered RESTful and GraphQL APIs for user management, event registration, and blockchain-integrated payments.
- **Production Deployment**: Deployed backend services using Docker, Railway, and Render for smooth CI/CD and scalable rollouts.
